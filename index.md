## Welcome!

Hello, tihs is Chis!

I'm a freshman of Math and Computer Science Department in FZU.Though my first term of advanced language learning, I've preliminarily aquired C and start studying Java.

As a slow learner, I'm now quite anxious about my study path. But I strongly believe that I will catch up through hard work anyway.

Good day!
