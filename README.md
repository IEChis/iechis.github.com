# Welcome to iechis.github.com
I'm a freshman of Math and Computer Science Department in FZU.  
Though my first term of advanced language learning, I've aquired part of C and started studying Java. However, I haven't master them yet. There is still a long way to go.  
As a slow learner, I'm now quite anxious about my study path. But I strongly believe that I will catch up through hard work anyway.
